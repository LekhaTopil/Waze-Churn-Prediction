# **Waze-Churn-Prediction**

# **Waze**
Waze, a free navigation app owned by Google, makes it easier for drivers around the world to reach their destinations. Waze's community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer.

### **Churn V/s Retained:**
Churn quantifies users who have uninstalled the app and no longer use the Waze app. Retained users are those who are still using the app and have not uninstalled it.

# **Project Goal:**
Develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and contribute to the growth of Waze's business.
